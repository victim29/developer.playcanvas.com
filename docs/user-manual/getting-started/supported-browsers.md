:::tip

We recommend using an up-to-date operating system and browser when running PlayCanvas apps and tools.

## WebGL Support

At the very minimum, a browser must have a working [WebGL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL) 1.0 implementation for PlayCanvas to run. If you are unsure whether your browser supports WebGL, visit [this page](https://get.webgl.org/). If you see a spinning cube, you are all set! 🎉
